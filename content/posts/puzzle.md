# Goal

Formulate problems and find out where I am in the process of solving them.
Help myself (and hopefully anyone that reads this) to learn how to take steps towards solving problems.
Adjust my understanding based on what I have learned, write it down and repeat this as much as possible.


## Some problems (jump to the next chapter for the juice)

The economy exists. [^Intro] Fast forward to 2020, and the world has grown complicated.
People will probably use computers and smartphones (aren't they all the same already?)
with the hope of handling work (and life in general)
more efficiently.

People mostly have Windows computers and Android phones. [^osShares]
Probably they will register business data in Excel spreadsheets, share it via email
and try to do something useful with the information.

[^Intro]: Statistically, someone starts a business or works in a business, they want to invest time and effort (or work), provide something useful, and harvest the results. Statistically a person will harvest the work in form of $Money$. They pay money to work more efficiently and hopefully one day they get this money back plus some earnings. This has been more or less universal for many centuries.

[^osShares]: You dont believe me or you're reading this from the future? check [THIS wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems)

If a business grows (and oh boy isn't that the ultimate goal?), the spreadsheet will probably grow as well.
This is good and bad.

On one hand, people don't have time to maintain computer files.
They're busy making their business grow.

On the other hand, computer files are useful to make a business grow.

Efficient handling of files across people and computers
is one of the main problems' software is trying to solve.

## What I think I can fix

Some people I know use Excel files to enter business information.
They modify this information and share via email.

I think business information should be (at least):
* safely stored.
* easy to share.
* easily understandable for anyone that access the data.
* quickly and intuitively expandable.
* clearly organized.

## Why not Excel

Excel already can take care of all of this, what are the issues I want to solve?

#### Data isn't safely stored.
An Excel file just lives in the hard drives of the computers that download it.
Probably in some emails. This is arguably not safe enough for a business for many reasons.

#### If you share an Excel file, another person should use Excel to read it in the best way.
Imagine you could only eat one type of food, or meet with one person your entire life.
Not very fun. Having viable options feels quite good.

#### The usual way excel displays data is with tables.
There are other types of more human friendly visuals, but they're not very intuitive to make and update.

#### Time-consuming without even noticing.
When expanding data in excel, nothing prevents you of entering wrong, or repetitive data.

#### Relationships between data entries are not clear.
Your eyes get tired in excel, and you fall into rabbit holes quickly.
Easy to make mistakes and to make false assumptions about the data.

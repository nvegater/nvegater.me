I want to adjust my understanding based on learnings and
repeat this as much as my chill perspective on life allows it.

Particularly now I want to observe how I think about problems and
find out where I am in the process of solving them.

## What problem?

The economy exists, the world is complicated [^Intro], and
most of us use technology to cope better with life.

[^Intro]: People start business or works in a business, they want to invest time, effort and work to do something useful, and harvest the results. Statistically a person will harvest the work in form of $Money$. They pay money to work more efficiently and hopefully one day they get this money back plus some earnings. This has been more or less universal for some years I guess.

People mostly have Windows computers and Android phones[^osShares] where they type data,
share it and try to do something useful with it.

[^osShares]: You dont believe me or you're reading this from the future? check [THIS wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems)

`FinalVERSION_FINAL_FINAL.xslx` files grow exponentially along with the growing businesses.
GROWTH is a religion in disguise where
Bill Gates is the Pope,
Bezos is Saint Peter,
Google is Jesuschrist,
Excel sucks...

But without being so dramatic, there is a lot of binary data everywhere.
Nowadays this data is practically a currency.

But who has time to maintain this annoying computer files anymore?
The idea behind a business is to provide value and people are busy "Business growing".

People need data to "business-grow", and they can't "business-grow" if they invest too much time focusing on data.

Software is a tool that helps humans handle, clean, organize and display data.
Without having to worry about data, people have space in their heads for other things.
Focus on other people, on better ideas, self reflection.
More complex situations that no tool will do for us.

## What I think I can fix

Data is an abstraction of you, me and everything we humans do.
Is like your house or your room. It says a lot about us (go clean your room).

Houses have been with humans longer than binary data.
They've evolved during millennia.

Is like a restaurant that has the best tacos in town, and they decide they want to make cakes.
It took the restaurant 10 years to develop the best taco,
and it will probably take also some years to have the best cake.

Data is the Cake in humanities restaurant. Houses are like the tacos.
What is missing in our Cake, that we have in our tacos?

#### No Privacy.
A file lives in the hard drives of the computers that download it.
Probably in some emails. None of these absolutely protects data from corruption.

#### No universal data reader.
There are so many languages in technology. (programming languages, file types, extensions, standards etc...)
Having viable options feels quite good. But there should be some universal fallback when things are not working out.
Like English Langua

#### The usual way excel displays data is with tables.
There are other types of more human friendly visuals, but they're not very intuitive to make and update.

#### Time-consuming without even noticing.
When expanding data in excel, nothing prevents you of entering wrong, or repetitive data.

#### Relationships between data entries are not clear.
Your eyes get tired in excel, and you fall into rabbit holes quickly.
Easy to make mistakes and to make false assumptions about the data.

Markdown (MD) is quite useful. Concretely because:

MDX is basically MD + React as mentioned in
[this medium article](https://medium.com/@alexkrolick/writing-interactive-documents-in-markdown-with-mdx-4b6dd7db683d).


I was impressed by this combination the first time because Daniel Eden, the main system designer of Facebook,
[uses MDX](https://github.com/daneden)
in his
[website](https://daneden.me/).

Then I started investigating more about it. I stumbled upon this [article,](https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-mdxjs/)
which pretty much explains better than me, how powerful MDX is. It also shows a lot of use cases.

My favourite until now is ["Up and down the ladder of abstraction"](http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction)
by Victor Bret. Thats more or less my goal for MDX.

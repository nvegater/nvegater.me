Markdown (MD) is quite useful. Concretely because:

MDX is basically MD + React as mentioned in
[this medium article](https://medium.com/@alexkrolick/writing-interactive-documents-in-markdown-with-mdx-4b6dd7db683d).


I was impressed by this combination the first time because Daniel Eden, the main system designer of Facebook,
[uses MDX](https://github.com/daneden)
in his
[website](https://daneden.me/).

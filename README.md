Welcome to my site!

```js
console.log(`Hello world, 2 + 2 = 5 or ${2 + 2}`);
```

This file is in [github](https://github.com/nvegater/nvegater.me)
and also (in the future) compiled [here](https://nvegater.com).

Mainly 3 "tools" are being used to build this website:

* React
* Gatsby
* Graphql

The main purposes are:

* Learn Graphql and Gatsby (react I kind of know good enough to get paid).
* Create a portfolio and blog

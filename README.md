This file is in [github](https://github.com/nvegater/nvegater.me)
and also (in the future) compiled [here](https://nvegater.com).

Mainly 3 "tools" are being used to build this website:

* React
* Gatsby
* Graphql

The main purposes are:

* Learn Graphql and Gatsby.
* Improve React skills.
* Create a portfolio and blog to register the learning process.
